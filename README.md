# Raspberry Pi Pico W Webserver
This project implements a simple web server program running on a Raspberry Pi Pico W\n 
microcontroller, allowing users to interact with it over Wi-Fi through a web interface.

# Features
Wi-Fi Connection: Enables users to connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to their local Wi-Fi network.
Web Interface: Provides a web-based user interface for controlling and monitoring the microcontroller.
Login System: Implements a basic login system to authenticate users and control access to certain features.
LED Toggle: Demonstrates the functionality of toggling an LED on the Raspberry Pi Pico W through the web interface.
# Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure you have the following:

Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller
Micro-USB cable
Wi-Fi network with internet access
Python development environment installed on your computer
# Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raspberry-pi-pico-w-webserver.git
Navigate to the Directory: Move into the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd raspberry-pi-pico-w-webserver
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python dependencies using pip.

bash
Copy code
pip install adafruit-ampy
Upload Files to Raspberry Pi Pico W: Use Adafruit ampy to upload the Python files (main.py, login.html, welcome.html) to your Raspberry Pi Pico W.

bash
Copy code
ampy --port /path/to/your/pico put main.py
ampy --port /path/to/your/pico put login.html
ampy --port /path/to/your/pico put welcome.html
Connect to Wi-Fi: Modify the connect_wifi_manually() function in main.py to connect to your Wi-Fi network. You can either manually enter your SSID and password or scan for available networks.

Run the Program: Safely eject the Raspberry Pi Pico W from your computer and power it on. The program will start running automatically.

Access the Web Interface: Once the Raspberry Pi Pico W is connected to your Wi-Fi network, you can access the web interface by entering its IP address in a web browser.

# Usage
Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi Pico W.
Follow the on-screen instructions to log in and interact with the microcontroller.
Toggle the LED on/off or perform other actions available in the web interface.
